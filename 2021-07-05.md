i'm lazy god damn

i'll recap the last 2-ish days:
- i received that keyboard i bought.
  - it's actually kind of bad out of the box. but ah well.
  - i went ahead and opened it up, to put the included packing foam in the bottom half of the case.
  - thankfully i didn't break anything while doing that, so now i have a significantly better sounding keyboard.
  - i kind of want to publish a sound test somewhere, but my recording is very uh... lopsided. so, not right now, i guess.
- besides that, business as usual. i played games, you know the drill.
