it has been around 11 days since my last entry. since then, a lot has happened, but i'll keep this one short.

- finally got my electricity back
  - for those who don't know: texas suffered a massive winter storm that took down most of the state's energy supply
    - there's a lot of politics around it, but just know: they were cheap on everything they could be cheap on
    - [[texas-2021-power-outage]]
- played a LOT of games today... you kind of do that when you're a game addict and are forcibly seperated from them for ~4 days
  - [[genshin-impact]]
  - [[rocket-league]]
  - [[minecraft]]
  - [[csgo]]
  - [[osu]]
- while the power was out:
  - read around 50 chapters of [[komi-cant-communicate]]
  - did basically nothing else
