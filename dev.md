# dev

sometimes i do programming on my free time. i was more active in the past but got kind of burnt out - so now i only work when i think of a new project most of the time.

## my favorite languages

python for its simplicity and popularity

rust for its cool concepts and being a good way to break into systems programming

## languages i dislike

javascript - even though i do frequently use it, it's just kind of awkward to use imo
