# *Genshin Impact*
a (for the most part, incomplete) open world RPG (with "gacha" monetization) developed by a Chinese game studio named "miHoYo."

## controversies
many people (including myself) have gotten a bit heated about the game mechanics. for example, a unnecessarily long "resin" (or stamina) recharge rate. the maximum resin cap is 160 at the moment, and 1 resin recharges per 8 minutes. most level materials are locked behind this system - so it is kind of annoying.
the list of possible annoyances that people have complained about (for good reason) is long, but i guess that's what happens when you're a chinese game developer trying to get your game into the west (which have different standards).

## where can i get it?
the Windows version is downloadable via their custom launcher, which you can get [here](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/download). Android/iOS/PS4 versions are available on their respective stores.
