# setup

i currently do everything on an [HP Desktop M01-F0014](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-desktop-amd-ryzen-3-series-8gb-memory-256gb-solid-state-drive-jet-black/6366134.p?skuId=6366134) (bought from Best Buy, around $500 inc. tax). it has a Ryzen 3 3200G, 8GB RAM, and around 240GB of usable SSD storage.

my current peripherals are a Corsair K55 (membrane) "gaming" keyboard, a Logitech G203 "gaming" mouse, and a Westinghouse TV from years ago.

## upgrades? upgrades.

this computer is too confined for my usages - the graphics don't work very well on games, not to mention it uses 2GB of my RAM as VRAM, so i'm always using at least 70% of the RAM in the machine just doing usual business (that might just be Windows though).

on the 20th of January I bought a CyberpowerPC tower, which should be arriving a few days after. the specs are around average - i5-10400F, 1660 Super, 8GB RAM, 500GB SSD. still miles better than my current setup!
