# setup

my current computer is a [CyberPowerPC GXiVR8060A10](https://www.amazon.com/CyberpowerPC-Xtreme-i5-10400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A10/dp/B08FBK2DK5) (Amazon link). it has a i5-10400F, a 1660 Super, 8GB RAM, and a 500GB SSD. also pretty lights on the case.

it does its job quite well. and considering the current computer part shortages it's not a bad buy.

my current peripherals are a Keychron C1 mechanical keyboard (Keychron Browns, foam modded), a Logitech G203 "gaming" mouse, and a Dynex 32" TV from years ago.
## upgrades? upgrades

i am currently planning on upgrading the storage first. most likely through a 1TB SSD, as i can't really stand hard drives now (once you go SSD, you can't go back).

once that gets done, a RAM upgrade is next on the list, and then I probably won't touch it for a year or two. it already runs my games at good framerates on 1080p, so no change is needed unless i just want to spend money for the hell of it.
