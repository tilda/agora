well, i'm back once again. this is one of the only outlets i have to write my feelings out on, at the moment.

my discord account got disabled for 0 reason. this means that most "vent" channels i could have access to are no longer accessible because well, i can't access discord. so this place might actually get use again for the next few days.

to recap, on the 10th, some people started seeing my messages as "spam" - i initially thought "that's funny", laughed, and moved on. 2 days later, i received an email proclaiming my account had been disabled for "spam and/or platform abuse". "oh, i have other accounts i can use though," i thought. little did i know how easy it was to also get accounts locked, with phone verification required. since i had my phone number on my main account which was now banned, discord also blacklisted my phone number from use on any other accounts.

i *have* contacted discord support and am just waiting for a response from them, my hopes are not super high. and in general i'm pissed. i am potentially losing 5 years of my life, most if not all of my friends, to a simple "flag" on my account and it sucks. i am trying to keep my head up but it's hard when a platform treats you as an enemy from the start.

as a sidenote, i created a telegram account under @iamtilda - if you need to make contact with me, this is probably the best way at the moment besides twitter or osu!.

i also want to tackle why i've been so inactive in using this agora. i think i mostly got demotivated because i wrote the same things every day, having done the same things every day for a while now. so i think i might try and do new things every day now. if i think about it, discord was really holding me back, a procrastination tool disguised as a communications platform.

so, yes, you will probably see more entries in the coming days. hopefully i can keep myself to it.
