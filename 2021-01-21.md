i'm not fully back just yet - but i'll probably be picking up the pace from now on. right now i don't have as much workload on me.

- **new semester!** i didn't expect to make it past the first but i somehow did
- bought a new computer - a "CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC" (as if that makes it anymore special) off Amazon for $800. was a really good deal - a computer with a 1660 Super for $800!
  - i originally wanted to build my own but considering the fact that i set up a bot for GPU stock and still wasn't able to get one, i think it's pretty fair to just buy this and call it a day
