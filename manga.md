# manga

while [[anime]] is cool, sometimes i prefer to do things at my own pace and not how the adaptation does it. this is usually why i read manga.

unlike anime, i usually don't mind if the series is still going since there is tons of reading material by the time i get to it. there aren't many finished manga series - if i only read those my life wouldn't be as good.

## how i read manga

i use [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/) (Android only) on my phone. much like the setup in [[anime]], Tachiyomi updates my information on [my AniList profile](https://anilist.co/user/tda) after i finish reading a chapter.

the extensions i use on Tachiyomi are *MangaDex*, *MangaLife*, and *Mangasee*, to be able to reach everything I'm interested in. this has worked great for the most part.

## about legal manga

i would love to go legal, but i do not have the required funds, so i'm kind of stuck pirating. i'll definitely buy the things i've read when it's possible for me to!

## why i read manga

because i'm bored
