# my thoughts on 2020

2020 was a wild year because of how so much happened. i went from getting a new computer, to staying inside for months on end because of covid. it was just so weird and it happened all so suddenly.

now that we're in 2021, i don't really know what to say. that year was just so weird and unpredictable, so many things happened.

but i guess the only thing we can do is move on. no matter how we think about it - time moves on, and so should we.
