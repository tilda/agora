# 2020-12-30

this is the day i started my agora :) but besides that:

- made plans to return my pair of HyperX Cloud Alpha headphones.
  - sound-wise, it was fine. however, they clamp on your head, and that just doesn't work for me.
  - was a exchange from my local GameStop (that was not my decision)
    - the old pair was the Razer Kraken X's, which suffered the same problem
      - part of [[christmas-2020]]

- made plans to buy a mechanical keyboard finally
  - the mechanical keyboard i am planning to buy: an [Epomaker SK87][1].
    - white color because it's more aesthetically pleasing for me
    - Gateron Optical Browns as the switch
      - the keyboard is hotswappable, so if i don't like it i'll just buy some different switches probably
    - this will be bought using the money from the return of the Cloud Alphas.
