this is the day i started my agora :) but besides that:

    - made plans to return my pair of HyperX Cloud Alpha headphones.

      - their quality was fine, was just uncomfortable with them. they clamped on my head a bit too much, i prefer a looser fit.

      - was a exchange from my local GameStop (that was not my decision)
        - the old pair was the Razer Kraken X's, which suffered the same problem
          - part of [[christmas-2020]]

    - made plans to buy a mechanical keyboard finally

      - the mechanical keyboard i am planning to buy: an [Epomaker SK87 (white, Gateron Optical Browns)](https://epomaker.com/collections/tkl-86/products/epomaker-sk87-abs?variant=31895679369289).

      - this will be bought using the money from the return of the Cloud Alphas.
