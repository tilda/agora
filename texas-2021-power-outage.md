# Texas 2021 Big Power Outage

(for lack of a better name)

basically, what happened:
    - texas' energy grid is seperated from all the other states, because they are cheap and want profits
      - being seperated from the federal grid means they can ignore the guidelines and requirements, allowing them to cheap out on a LOT
    - they did not winterize/weather-proof anything. why? "oh, this barely happens. whatever!"
      - these people obviously do not think ahead
    - when a big winter storm came in february 2021, it obviously took out everything (even though they knew it would happen, actually)
    - a lot of pipes burst due to the freezing temperatures, ruining houses across the state
    - meanwhile, downtown in dallas/austin, big buildings with no one in them continued to be lit up, and the wealthier parts of town too!
    - all this while people were freezing their butts off for 3 or 4 days.
