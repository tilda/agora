hey, it's been a while. it's like, i forgot about this almost but it was in the back of my mind. today i thought, "maybe i should pick this back up." so, here i am. hopefully i can get back on track for daily entries.

anyways:
- woke up relatively late (unfortunately summer has messed up my sleep schedule pretty badly >_>)
- got a notification i passed my summer classes! pretty happy about this, i thought i was kind of just not going to pass.
- this one is fun: because of ^, my mom bought me a new keyboard.
  - Keychron C1 with Keychron Brown switches
  - hotswappable(!) i'll probably order some other switches a few months from now and play around with them.
  - of course, i still have to consider... this is an expensive hobby. i hope i don't go too far LOL

i'm still a bit tired from my absolutely awful sleep schedule but ah well what can you do about that. hopefully i can fix that in the next few days.
