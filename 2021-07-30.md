hey it's me again~

i've decided i'm not going to treat this as a requirement, i'll just write when i feel like it. after all i think it got boring just writing "i played games" after a while.

i got my first part of the covid vaccination, pfizer to be specific. it was definitely quicker than i expected. all that's happened is my arm feels sore, so i'm happy with that. can't wait for the second shot to knock me down :D /s

after that i got raising cane's (chicken), enjoyable as always. went home and ate, then played minecraft with my friend for the rest of the day. it was a pretty decent day overall.

i am a little worried about my vaccination schedule though. unfortunately for me i signed up for an [[osu]] tournament a week or so ago and qualifiers are going to start very soon. so i don't know if i'll be able to make it through the tournament before my 2nd shot in 3 weeks or so.

anyways, that's all for today.
