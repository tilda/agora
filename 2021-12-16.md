# 2021-12-16

hi there, i skipped a day. lol.

anyways, the day after i wrote [[2021-12-14]] i actually happened to get my discord account back with everything intact. the spam filter seemed to have caught me somehow - dunno how or why but i'm just happy i got it back. and also i exported a data package, not going to make those same mistakes again.

so maybe i don't need to vent here anymore - they did their jobs.

anyhow, i'm going out for some food today after writing this entry - i might update how that goes after i get back :)
